My name is Sheesh Mohsin, a student of B.Tech in Computer Science & Engineering at Dr.B.C.Roy Engineering College, Durgapur. 
I came to know about the `Summer Training 2013 <http://dgplug.org/summertraining/>`_  from the seniors of my college.I have got to know several things which are as follows:-

- Knowledge of linux and `basic commands <http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/>`_ that are used in terminal generally.
- `Git <http://git-scm.com/>`_- A version controlled system
- `vim <http://git-scm.com/>`_- An editor or an open source software.
- `Python <http://python.org>`_- A high level language, which is widely used in now-a-days, it is an interactive, object-oriented, extensible programming language. It provides an extraordinary combination of clarity and versatility.

This training is still going on, and i found that it is much effective for me. Learning a lot from this training. This training is going on under `Kushal Das <http://kushaldas.in/>`_
